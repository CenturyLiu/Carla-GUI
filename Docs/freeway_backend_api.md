# Freeway Backend API reference

This reference discusses the APIs the urban backend provides, and offers some examples to help user understand how to use these APIs.

Different from the urban back end, the freeway back end has intergrated the simulation environment creation, simulation scenario creation and simulation start function in a single class called "FreewayEnv". This page will discuss the methods provided by this class. The implementation details is hidden from users.

## FreewayEnv

The FreewayEnv class is the container for the freeway simulation environment. Users can initialize simulation environment, add and edit simulation scenarios and start the simulation by using methods provided by this class.

### Instance Variables

- **<font color="#f8805a">number_of_sections</font>**(int) 	
  The number of sections user want to have for a freeway simulation environment.

- **<font color="#f8805a">max_speed</font>**(float) 	
  The maximum speed allowed for the vehicles to navigate inside the simulation environment. Unit: m/s. Default is 30 m/s.

- **<font color="#f8805a">min_speed</font>**(float) 	
  The minimum speed allowed for the vehicles to navigate inside the simulation environment. Unit: m/s. Default is 15 m/s.

    The speed under "speed" mode will be hold as the average of the max_speed and min_speed, i.e. navigation_speed = (max_speed + min_speed) / 2

### Methods

- **<font color="#7fb800">add_ego_vehicle</font>**(<font color="#00a6ed">**self, model_name = "vehicle.tesla.model3", safety_distance = 15.0, vehicle_color = None**</font>)

## Demo Code Recipe

Here is a demo for using the back end. The code below creates a 7-section environment, adds 3 lead vehicles, 3 follow vehicles and the ego vehicle, edits control to vehicles in section 1, 3, 4, 6 and then starts the simulation. This example is also available at [test_freeway_backend](https://github.com/CenturyLiu/Carla-GUI/blob/master/gui_interface/test_freeway_backend.py)

Note:

    Note: the first time you run the code, the following error may occur:

        RuntimeError: time-out of 10000ms while waiting for the simulator, make sure the simulator is ready and connected to localhost:2000

        UnboundLocalError: local variable 'env' referenced before assignment

    This is because the carla client failed to connect to the carla server. Just run the code again and it should be fine.
