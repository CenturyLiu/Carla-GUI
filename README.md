# Carla-GUI
GUI tool helping vehicle-human interaction researchers to design and conduct traffic experiments with [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/).

## Introduction

The [CARLA simulator](https://carla.org/) is a powerful open source tool developed to "support development, training, and validation of autonomous driving systems". To properly utilize the powerful function provided by the CARLA simulator, however, users need to have 

   - in depth understanding about the function provided by the simulator
   - basic knowledge about vehicle control
   - basic knowledge about python
   
 Meeting all these requirements is definitely not a easy job for beginner researchers in the field of vehicle-human interaction. To make life easier for those researchers, we are here to present our simple GUI, which is an interface for users to create and conduct experiments inside the CARLA simulator.
